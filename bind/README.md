# Web3API Binding

Generates Web3API schema bindings for supported guest languages.

## Details

Web3API uses MessagePack as a common data interchange format between languages. This allows Web3API WASM modules, authored in different langues, to be run within a single host language (JS, Rust, Python, Go, C#, C++).

MessagePack encoded data is sent between module boundaries. Decoding of the message will happen in the destination environment, using generated binding code, created by this package.
